.TH CHRPATH 1 "May 4, 2002" "chrpath" "change rpath/runpath in binaries"
.SH NAME
chrpath \- change the rpath or runpath in binaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBchrpath\fP
[ \fB-v\fP | \fB--version\fP ]
[ \fB-d\fP | \fB--delete\fP ]
[ \fB-r\fP \fI<path>\fP |\  \fB--replace\fP \fI<path>\fP ]
[ \fB-c\fP | \fB--convert\fP ]
[ \fB-l\fP | \fB--list\fP ]
[ \fB-h\fP | \fB--help\fP ]
\fI<program>\fP [ \fI<program>\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchrpath\fP changes, lists or removes the rpath or runpath setting in a
binary.  The rpath, or runpath if it is present, is where the runtime linker
should look for the libraries needed for a program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -v \ |\  --version
Display program version number
.TP
.BR -d \ |\  --delete
Delete current rpath or runpath setting
.TP
.BR -c \ |\  --convert
Convert the rpath setting into a runpath setting
.TP
.BI -r\ \fI<path>\fP\ |\ --replace\ \fI<path>\fP
Replace current rpath or runpath setting with the path given.  The new
path must be shorter or the same length as the current path.
.TP
.BR -k \ |\  --keepgoing
Do not fail on first error, but process all arguments before returning
the error.
.TP
.BR -l \ |\  --list
List the current rpath or runpath (default)
.TP
.BR -h \ |\  --help
Show usage information.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.BR 0
If all operations were successful
.TP
.BR > 0
if one of the operations failed.  A failing operation terminates
the program unless -k is specified.

.SH BUGS
This program cannot create an RPATH tag if the ELF does not have one,
and it can only replace an RPATH with one of equal or shorter
length. (Moving ELF sections following a lengthened string table would
be difficult and error-prone at best, and is sometimes outright
impossible due to issues like limited ranges in jump instructions.)
