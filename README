chrpath
=======

chrpath allows you to modify the dynamic library load path (rpath) of
compiled programs.  Currently, only removing and modifying the rpath
is supported.  Eventually, I hope to be able to add an rpath if it is
missing.

This tool is based on two small programs I found on the GCC mailing
list.

There is elfhack by Ric Klaren doing almost the same thing, and a bit
more.  <URL:http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/software/>.
